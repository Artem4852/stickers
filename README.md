# Stickers

This repository contains some stickers I've made, inspired by a workshop which happened in [HackClub](https://hackclub.com/) which I didn't visit. They worked in Figma, but I prefer Photoshop, which is why the stickers are in PSD and PNG formats. You will find two folders here. "hackclub" folder includes stickers related to HackClub and its projects, and "other" folder contains miscellaneous stickers.

## HackClub
